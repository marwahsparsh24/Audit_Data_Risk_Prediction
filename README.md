# Audit Data Risk Prediction

## Overview

This project predicts audit risks based on provided datasets (audit_data.csv and trial.csv). It includes data preprocessing steps, model building, and evaluation using machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees.

## Contents

**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, encoding categorical variables, and handling multicollinearity.

**Machine Learning Models**: Various models to predict audit risks.

**Evaluation Metrics**: Uses accuracy and F1 score to evaluate model performance.

## Installation

**Clone the repository**:

```bash Copy code
git clone https://github.com/marwahsparsh24/Audit_Data_Risk_Prediction.git
```

**Install the necessary packages**:

```bash Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
## Usage

- Place the audit_data.csv and trial.csv files in the same directory as the notebook.
- Run the notebook to execute each cell in order.

## Structure

**Data Preprocessing**: Label encoding, multicollinearity checks, and scaling.

**Model Training**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree models.

**Evaluation**: Performance metrics to assess model predictions.

## Dependencies

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
